	- Link: https://gtaforums.com/topic/915206-iveflc-sweet-autumn
	- Notes: Replace the 'timecyc.dat' file in the EFLC folders (TLAD and TBoGT) too, as they load their own versions of it, and not GTA IV's.
			   You don't need to add the timcycle modifiers to them, though, as they load the same versions GTA IV does.

+ **Responsive plus:**
	- Link: https://gtaforums.com/topic/931069-iveflc-responsive-plus
	- Notes: 
		- In order to replace and add the archived files, you'll have to use a file modding tool such as OpenIV.
		- If you have the Complete Edition, you have only the GTA IV folder, so you'll have to copy the TLAD and TBoGT related files from the EFLC folder of the mod and install them over your TLAD and TBoGT folders.
		- Once installed, also use Additionals -> Compatibility with Improved Animations Pack. 
			   
+ **Improved Animations Pack:**

	- Notes:
		- In order to replace and add the archived files, you'll have to use a file modding tool such as OpenIV.
		- Exclude the WeaponInfo.xml from this, it'll overwrite the compatibility used above.

+ **Potential Grim:**

		- In order to replace and add the archived files, you'll have to use a file modding tool such as OpenIV.
